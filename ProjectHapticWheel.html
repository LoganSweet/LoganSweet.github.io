										<h1>Haptic Wheel (In Progress)</h1>

										<h4> For an Elecanisms course project, I created a haptic-feedback wheel with a few different modes: off, constant left, constant right, return to zero position, spring, damper, a texture on turning, and an impassable wall. </h4>

                                        <h2>Mechanical System</h2>

                                        <p>The wheel and mount is made of lasersut MDF, and was designed in SolidWorks. I made sure all my parts fit together in a SolidWorks assembly but did not adjust the widths of pressfit joints afterwards, so I used hot glue on the back of the assembled system to hold the mount together. The wheel is press-fit to a press fit threaded insert attached to a shoulder bolt that allows it to rotate freely. The wheel is directly controlled by the motor instead of through a transmission, which is the biggest thing I would change if I did this project again: there isn't enough torque to push too hard on the wheel wiothout overpowering the motor.  <p>

                                        <h2>Hardware & Sensing </h2>
										<p>The rear rotating axle of the motor has a small magnet attached, and a magnetic encoder board reads the angle of the magnet and wheel. The motors are driven by a motor driver board provided by the course instructors. The entire system is driven by a custom PIC24 micrcontroller board, also provided by the class.  </p>

                                        <h2>Software</h2>

                                        <p>The mode that the haptic wheel is running can be changed via a simple GUI created in Pythin using tkinter. Since I am relatively new to writing C, I decided to run all of my control code on the mocrocontroller, and just use Python to switch between different modes. I used example code provided by an instructor as a template to create USB vendor requests to update the mode that was running.</p>

										<p>After mode number was passed to the microcontroller, I used case statements to set a flag for the appropriate mode, then continually run the function associated with that flag. I created simple functions to run the PWM signal for the motor at either a constand value or at the value created by the product of two inputs.   </p>
