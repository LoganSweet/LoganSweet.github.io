										<center><h1>Bomb Defusal Penny Arcade Game</h1></center>
										<h4>For a final Elecanisms class project my team and I created a collaborative arcade game based on <i>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</i>. Our game runs on up to seven PIC24F microcontrollers that communicate via I2C.

                                        <h2>The Assignment </h2>
                                        <p>BombSquad is a penny-operated arcade game based on the VR/ PC game <a href="http://www.keeptalkinggame.com">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</a>. Similar to the source material, BombSquad challenges a group to collaboratively defuse a bomb, with a catch: only one team member can see the bomb, while the remaining players can see the (intentionally confusing) manual. We had a lot of fun playing the orignal game as a team, but thought it could be made more compellin with a physical interface instead of a digital one.  <p>

                                        <p>This was also a class assignement for the Olin College ENGR 3110: Elecanisms course, so there were a few requirements we had to follow. It had to be a penny-operated arcade game with significant mechaical, electtrical, and software components, and the majority of our firmware needed to run on a custom Microchip PIC24F board provided by a professor.  </p>

                                        <h2>The Game </h2>

                                        <h3>Modularity</h3>
										<p>Since we didn't quite know what we were getting into (only one teammate was comfortable with C before the start of the semester) we decided to make the game modular from the beginning. In <i>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</i> the player is presented with a few randomly-selected bomb modules to solve. These are independent from one another, but occasionally require checking the game serial number or other info to solve. Modeling after this, we decided to make a number of semi-independent games that could easily connect and detatch from the main structural frame of the game. Our designs for the frame changed as the project went on, so we wanted to be sure that the code we wrote worked with any number of modules greater than zero.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>To make this solveable, we needed a manual as well.    </p>
